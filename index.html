                <p>Hi Folks, I am Pranaw from a small village near Karur. I am an average student studied in Government School where focus on individual students is very less and most of the times I have studied on my own without guidance for the exam. While studying on my own, I got interested in the software side. Initially I started learning C++ in my 11th computer science portion. Then I got interested and started learning python in my 12th Computer Science book portion as well.
                </p>
                <p>After that I started learning about coding and web development through internet and youtube tutorials on my own. I learned html,css,js and angular js. Since I don’t have a proper desktop/laptop most of the time I learn through the phone and try out coding on my relative's/friend’s laptop whenever I get the chance. Apart from coding, in my free time, I am learning ethical hacking as well and have interest in cyber security. I know basic concepts of phishing, virus/malware binding through image, payload android app creation for remote access (learning purpose).
